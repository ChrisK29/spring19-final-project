# SFSU CSC 690 - iOS course final project

- App name: **iTiluz**
- Author: Jakhongir Khusanov.
- Reviewer: [@Yordina](https://github.com/yordina)

English - Uzbek language translator & learner. The app UI will be based on my own transliteration app called [Tiluz](https://github.com/jkhusanov/tiluz) created with React Native. This new native iOS app will be logical continuation of my original plan where I've wanted to create all in one platform for people who want to advance both their native and foreign language skills.

## Getting started

**For the full and better experience use real device**

```
git clone https://github.com/csc-690-sfsu/spring19-final-project

cd iTiluz

xed .
```

## Things learned

This project helped me dive into Swift development and get my ideas into real life. I was able to compare Swift with React Native, I really liked how it provides simple yet powerful features out of the box. As I mentioned earlier I have experience with React Native and an app called Tiluz on app stores. I wanted to add more features to the app, and this project helps me to get started with those new features. Although the saved screen is not perfect, I'm really proud of my translator screen. It has 100% of what I wanted initially. I'll definitely keep working on this app and publish a new version of Tiluz soon.
